This is the static code for my blog, [Entropically curious](https://entropicallycurious.com/). The source code can be found at [this repo](https://github.com/Ledugus/blog-source).

The blog is built using the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
I use a [modified theme](https://github.com/Ledugus/hugo-paper) forked from [Hugo Paper](https://github.com/nanxiaobei/hugo-paper).
